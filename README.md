This repo is for anyone who wants to get started with Cucumber

I pieced together a bunch of different resources to create this ready to go Cucumber testing framework. I used help from others so I feel that I should pay it forward. Thanks to all that made setting up this framework for my own work possible.

To run, execute
'gradle cucumber'

Your results will show under build/reports/cucumber-report.html/index.html. It includes a cucumber report with screenshots on every step. (tied to 'log' methods)

Hope this serves you well.

Enjoy and feel free to post questions.
